Hi, there! My name is Julia Bowden.

I am a passionate and dedicated professional with a diverse background in communications, web design, education, customer service, and public service. I'm committed to making a positive impact through effective communication, creative problem-solving, and cultivating meaningful connections. I thrive on creative challenges and have a proven track record of delivering exceptional results in various roles throughout my professional career.

I currently work as a Communications Assistant at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where I contribute to and maintain the Fertig Lab, Division of Quantitative Sciences, and Convergence Institute's web presence. My responsibilities include website development/management, boosting online engagement and brand visibility, collaborating on project plans, and performing quality checks of work by reviewing with staff and students. Through my proficiency with GitHub and WordPress, I help ensure that all online presences are user-friendly and accessible while aligning with project goals. Through this position, I've utilized and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, Markdown, Figma, Canva, and Photoshop.

During my tenure as a Junior Registered Behavior Therapist at Verbal Beginnings, I worked closely with children on the autism spectrum using targeted 1:1 ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) interventions. By implementing treatment plans and maintaining precise data records, I adapted quickly to varying needs while always prioritizing client safety and dignity. My capacity to communicate effectively with families and colleagues allowed me to facilitate progress and maintain collaborative relationships. This role emphasized the importance of adaptability and empathy in helping individuals achieve their potential.

My background extends beyond communications and education into the realm of customer service and leadership. At Starbucks, I excelled as a Shift Supervisor and Barista Trainer, consistently delivering exceptional service, mentoring team members, training new staff, and ensuring seamless store operations. My dedication was recognized with the "Partner of the Quarter" award, showcasing my commitment to teamwork and excellence.

Venturing into international service, I proudly served as an English Language Co-teacher with the Peace Corps in North Macedonia. Upon arrival in my host country, I was immersed in the local culture of my training site, Gostivar, which is Macedonia's most diverse city. I then completed an 11-week intensive dual-language training program for Albanian and Macedonian as well as Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) technical training. I designed curricula, co-taught with local primary school teachers, and even led an engaging Spelling Bee club, fostering cross-cultural understanding and enhancing educational opportunities.

My commitment to literacy and education extended to my role as a Kâ€“3 Literacy Tutor at Harford Heights Elementary through AmeriCorps. By tailoring reading interventions to individual students, I fostered growth and development while engaging them with personalized incentives.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from St. Mary's College of Maryland. This academic foundation, complemented by minors in Anthropology and Sociology, reflects my approach to understanding complex human interactions. During my time there, I undertook a thought-provoking original research project examining the relationship between drag performance, self-esteem, and body esteem. I not only excelled academically but also actively participated in extracurricular activities, including varsity rowing, leading new and transfer student orientations, facilitating diversity initiatives, and participating in an enriching study abroad experience in Dublin, Ireland at University College Dublin.

Each step of my journey has shaped my ability to approach challenges with resilience, creativity, and an unwavering dedication to making a difference. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
